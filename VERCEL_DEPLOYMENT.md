# Vercel Deployment Instructions

This project is now properly configured for Vercel deployment.

## Key Changes Made:
1. ✅ Moved all frontend files to the root directory
2. ✅ Removed missing favicon references from HTML and manifest
3. ✅ Added proper Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`
4. ✅ Verified build process works correctly
5. ✅ Added test page at `/test.html`

## Deployment Steps:
1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically detect this as a Create React App
3. The build will use `npm run build` and deploy the `build/` directory

## Testing:
- Test page: https://your-app.vercel.app/test.html
- Main app: https://your-app.vercel.app/

## Environment Variables Needed in Vercel:
- `FINNHUB_API_KEY` (already configured)

The app should now deploy successfully without 404 errors.
